A friend is someone other than your family or partner with whom you share close affection. 
You share some common beliefs and values with them.
They can be in person or online, your next-door neighbor or someone 1,000 miles away. 
True friends are always compassionate and loyal to each other.
A good friend never betrays you in any way, never talks about you behind your back nor does anything that questions your friendship.
A good friend should be reliable. 
A good friend is a person who helps you become a better version of yourself. 
A good friend always loves you for who you are, and not your wealth or your looks. 
Friendship is never confined by the financial status of people. 
A king can be a true friend of a poor beggar, a poor labor can be a good friend of a rich industrialist. 
for example, Lord Krishna was in unconditional true lovable friendship with poor Sudama. 
The friendship of Krishna and Sudama is a milestone for all of us.
